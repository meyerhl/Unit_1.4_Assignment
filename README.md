# Unit_1.4_Assignment
Please view the ConvertToHexadecimal file for programming code.

The purpose of this project was to write a function in Java
that takes a String representation of a binary number as a
parameter and returns a String representation of the
hexadecimal equivalent.

Note: integers beyond 9 digits don't work in this example.
